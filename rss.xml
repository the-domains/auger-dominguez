            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Baldacci Vineyards at the cusp of Spring</h1><p>I recently visited the Baldacci Vineyards as a part of a project to document the seasonal changes of the vineyard throughout the year.  This trip was wet and foggy, drizzling on and off throughout the day - a weather system happen to be dumping a lot of much needed rain into the region.   It was actually very refreshing and made for some dramatic imagery but wasn't great for drone flying.</p></article>]]></description>
