I recently visited the Baldacci Vineyards as a part of a project to document the seasonal changes of the vineyard throughout the year.  This trip was wet and foggy, drizzling on and off throughout the day - a weather system happen to be dumping a lot of much needed rain into the region.   It was actually very refreshing and made for some dramatic imagery but wasn't great for drone flying.

The fields are left fallow, almost, letting the grass grow tall and let the vines rest over the winter. You can just about see them waking up from a winter's nap, the warm tropical rain.  The buds are starting to wake up and soon the shoots will be trimmed back to prep them for the next season's hard work of growing grapes.
